# Code Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Guidelines

Before you dive in, to keep things running smoothly for everyone and make sure your contribution aligns with the project's goals, please take a moment to review these guidelines:

- If you plan to add a **new feature** or make a significant **architectural change**, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/tuyuritio/astro-theme-thought-lite/issues) first to discuss your idea and design plan.
- A Pull Request should **solve only one problem** or **add one feature**. Please avoid bundling multiple, unrelated changes into a single PR.
- If you need to **refactor existing code** to support your new feature, please submit the refactoring as a separate PR *before* submitting the feature PR.
- If your PR introduces a **new user-facing feature** or **configuration option**, you **must** update relevant documentation to explain how to use it.
- Please make sure your changes pass **basic tests** and follow the project’s existing **code style**.
