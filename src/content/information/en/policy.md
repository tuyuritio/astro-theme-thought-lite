### Types of Data Collection

1. User-submitted data
    - Custom nickname (required for non-logged-in users)
    - Comment data: includes comment content and publication timestamps.
    - Comment drafts: unsent comment content that is saved in the browser's `localStorage` to allow restoring unfinished input.

    - Cloudflare Turnstile data: used to verify comment requests from non-logged-in users (see [Turnstile Privacy Addendum](https://www.cloudflare.com/turnstile-privacy-policy/)).

The following table provides an overview of the types of data collected, collection purposes, and storage locations:

### Data Usage Purposes

- Provide comment services: Collect and process user comment data, including comment content, comment drafts, publication time, user nickname or OAuth account information, to display user comments and interactive content on the site. For OAuth login users, their authenticated platform username, display name, and avatar information will also be displayed.
- Enhance user experience: Save user theme preference settings (light/dark mode) in localStorage to ensure users maintain their personalized interface settings on their next visit. For non-logged-in users, custom nickname is saved in localStorage for subsequent comments.
- Communication and notifications: For authorized OAuth login users, use Web Push subscription data to send desktop push notifications to promptly inform users about replies to their comments or other relevant interaction information.
- Security protection: Use Cloudflare Turnstile service to perform human verification for non-logged-in users, preventing comment abuse and malicious attacks.
- Internal analysis and service improvement: Use basic access log data provided by Cloudflare for site performance analysis and security monitoring to improve service quality and user experience.

### Data Storage and Protection

- Cloudflare D1: Comment data, OAuth login information, personal homepage links, and Web Push subscription data are all stored in the Cloudflare D1 database. This database provides enterprise-level security protection, including encrypted data storage, access control, and regular backups. All data transmission is conducted through encrypted connections.
- JWE Cookies: OAuth identity information and verification data during the authorization process are encrypted and stored in Cookies using JSON Web Encryption (JWE) technology. JWE provides end-to-end encryption protection, ensuring the security of sensitive authentication information during transmission and storage. Cookies are set with appropriate security flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- localStorage: User custom nickname, theme preference settings and comment drafts are stored in the browser's localStorage. This data is only stored on the user's local device and is not transmitted to the server. Users can clear this local data at any time through browser settings.
- HTTPS encryption: The entire site uses HTTPS encrypted transmission. All data transmitted between the client and server is protected by TLS/SSL encryption, preventing data from being stolen or tampered with during transmission.
- Cloudflare security protection: Utilize security services provided by Cloudflare, including DDoS protection, Web Application Firewall (WAF), Bot management, and threat intelligence to protect the site and user data from malicious attacks.
